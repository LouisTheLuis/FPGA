# 6.205
This repository contains the Verilog work I did for 6.205: Digital Systems Laboratory.

As an accidental `git reset --hard` was performed during the middle of lab05, I lost most of the progress made in lab04. And I am definitely NOT going to code that up again.

For details about the project made along with some classmates, check [here](https://github.com/alkeirn/optical_project).
